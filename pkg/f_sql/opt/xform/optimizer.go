// Optimizer transforms an input expression tree into the logically equivalent
// output expression tree with the lowest possible execution cost.
//
// To use the optimizer, construct an input expression tree by invoking
// construction methods on the Optimizer.Factory instance. The factory
// transforms the input expression into its canonical form as part of
// construction. Pass the root of the tree constructed by the factory to the
// Optimize method, along with a set of required physical properties that the
// expression must provide. The optimizer will return an Expr over the output
// expression tree with the lowest cost.
